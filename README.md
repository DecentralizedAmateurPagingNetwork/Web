# DAPNET Web
The default DAPNET Web-frontend.
Written in the [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) framework and built using [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

## Requirements
* Installed packages: `git`, `nodejs`, `npm`, `wget`
	* You should install a current Node.js version (e.g. v6 LTS) by following [these instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
	* This process will also install the `npm` binary
	* Be advised that most linux distributions ship an older version of Node.js which will not work correctly
* A running webserver (e.g. apache2, nginx, lighttpd, etc.)
* A running [DAPNET Core](https://github.com/DecentralizedAmateurPagingNetwork/Core) with a reachable REST-interface

## Installation
1. Download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DecentralizedAmateurPagingNetwork/Web.git`
2. Checkout a specific tag: `git checkout tags/v2.0.0`
	* This is highly recommended for improved stability and a consistent user experience
	* Also you should use the [latest tag](https://github.com/DecentralizedAmateurPagingNetwork/Web/releases)
3. Copy `src/store/defaultUrls.json.example` to `src/store/defaultUrls.json` and change the default url-settings
4. Copy `src/store/defaultText.json.example` to `src/store/defaultText.json` and change the default custom text (displayed on the home page)
	* You may use HTML markup here
5. Copy `src/store/defaultMap.json.example` to `src/store/defaultMap.json` and change the default map-settings
6. (Optional) Edit `static/js/custom.js` and insert your custom javascript code (e.g. a Piwik tracking code)
	* You may use jQuery here
7. Download the latest coverage-data from the central server and setup a cronjob to update these files regularly
	* Create directory `static/coverage/`
	* Run initial download of coverage-files: `cd static/coverage && wget -m -nv -nH -nd -np -R "index.html*" -e robots=off http://web.db0sda.ampr.org/dapnet-coverage/`
	* Put the following line into a cronjob, adapt the `PATH_WEB` variable and make sure it runs regularly
	```bash
	MAILTO=root
	PATH_WEB=/opt/dapnet/Web
    */5 * * * *    YOURUSERNAME    if [ ! -d $PATH_WEB/dist/assets/coverage ]; then mkdir $PATH_WEB/dist/assets/coverage; fi && wget -m -nv -nH -nd -np -R "index.html*" -e robots=off -P $PATH_WEB/dist/assets/coverage http://web.db0sda.ampr.org/dapnet-coverage/
	```
	* **Be aware:** this cronjob puts the latest coverage date directly into the `dist/assets/coverage/`-directory and thus overwrites the files generated by a previous `npm run build` command. It will not update the source-files in the `static/coverage/`-directory
8. Download all dependencies: `npm install`
9. Test your setup: `npm run dev`
	* Open your browser at `http://localhost:8081` and check that each of your customizations was successful
10. Generate the production build: `npm run build`
11. Copy your freshly generated files from `dist/` into your webserver's `htdocs/` directory
12. Done!

### Deployment into a subdirectory
It is recommended to serve the DAPNET Web module from its own sub-domain.
If you really need to use a sub-directory, make sure to edit `config/index.js` and adapt the content of line 11 (`publicPath`).
Now run `npm run build` again and the page should be rendered correctly.

### Access with port tcp/80 only
In case you want to server users who have strong firewall restrictions and cannot access the default API Port 8080, you can use your apache webserver with `mod_proxy` to redirect the API calls from port tcp/80 to the API Port. Add these lines to your apache config and restart apache:
```
ProxyPass "/api" "http://YOURNODEURL:8080"
ProxyPassReverse "/api" "http://YOURNODEURL:8080"
```
The file `defaultUrls.json` has to be adapted by
```
{
    "api": "http://YOURWEBSERVERURL/api",
    ...
}
```

## Updating
Before updating make sure to read the changelog and to backup your customized files (see above)!

1. Update your local repository: `git fetch`
2. Run through step 2 of the installation process
	* Again you should use the [latest tag](https://github.com/DecentralizedAmateurPagingNetwork/Web/releases)
3. Run through steps 8. to 11. of the installation process
4. Done!
